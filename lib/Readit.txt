Hi there,
Available functions are 
        1)get_int()
        2)get_float()
        3)get_char()
        4)get_string_EOF()
        5)get_string_NL()

1)get_int:
    It just accepts an integer from the user in runtime and allocates to the variable that you have created

USAGE: 
     int a = get_int();

2)get_float:
    It just accepts float value from the user in runtime and allocates to the variable that you have created

USAGE: 
     int a = get_float();


3)get_char:
    It just accepts character from the user in runtime and allocates to the variable that you have created

USAGE:
     char a = get_char();

4)get_string_EOF:
    * It accepts a string which is terminated by EOF(ctrl+d)
    * It should be used with pointer

USAGE:
     char *a;
     a = get_string_EOF();
     printf("%s",a);

5)get_string_NL:
    * It also accepts a string which is terminated by newline(enter)
    * It should be used with pointer

USAGE:
     char *a;
     a = get_string_NL();
     printf("%s",a);
